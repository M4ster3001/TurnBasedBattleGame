Reference link: [Turn Based Battle Game video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7Z7R25spkE).

In this project a simple turn-based battle game was created.
<p>When the project finishes loading, you will see Star Game Button, click on it and battle will begin. You can attack or cast a magic or heal, the opponent has the same options.</p>
<p>The opponent's choice logic is simple, he has an array containing the three options, where a Math.floor with Math.random is used to selected the option in the array.</p>

## Starting the project:
